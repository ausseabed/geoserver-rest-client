# geoserver-rest-client
Geoserver-rest-api is a set of python api bindings to the REST API for Geoserver 2.17.0. It has been autogenerated by swagger from the OpenAPI documents provided by geoserver (with some tweaking).

These are derived using swagger v3.0.19. Some yaml files have been modified to conform
to the interfaces of geoserver's REST interface.

As these incorporate logic from geoserver they are supplied under GPL licensing.
