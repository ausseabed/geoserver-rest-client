  title: GeoServer Feature Types
  description: A feature type is a vector based spatial resource or data set that originates from a data store. In some cases, such as with a shapefile, a feature type has a one-to-one relationship with its data store. In other cases, such as PostGIS, the relationship of feature type to data store is many-to-one, feature types corresponding to a table in the database.

In particular, the native bounding box is recalculated when the projection or projection policy are changed, and the lat/lon bounding box is recalculated when the native bounding box is recalculated, or when a new native bounding box is explicitly provided in the request. (The native and lat/lon bounding boxes are not automatically recalculated when they are explicitly included in the request.) In addition, the client may explicitly request a fixed set of fields to calculate, by including a comma-separated list of their names in the recalculate parameter.  The empty parameter 'recalculate=' is useful avoid slow recalculation when operating against large datasets as 'recalculate=' avoids calculating any fields, regardless of any changes to projection, projection policy, etc. The nativebbox parameter 'recalculate=nativebbox' is used recalculates the native bounding box, while avoiding recalculating the lat/lon bounding box. Recalculate parameters can be used in together - 'recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox' can be used after a bulk import to  to recalculates both the native bounding box and the lat/lon bounding box.

          description: Specifies whether to recalculate any bounding boxes for a feature type. Some properties of feature types are automatically recalculated when necessary. In particular, the native bounding box is recalculated when the projection or projection policy are changed, and the lat/lon bounding box is recalculated when the native bounding box is recalculated, or when a new native bounding box is explicitly provided in the request. (The native and lat/lon bounding boxes are not automatically recalculated when they are explicitly included in the request.) In addition, the client may explicitly request a fixed set of fields to calculate, by including a comma-separated list of their names in the recalculate parameter.  The empty parameter 'recalculate=' is useful avoid slow recalculation when operating against large datasets as 'recalculate=' avoids calculating any fields, regardless of any changes to projection, projection policy, etc. The nativebbox parameter 'recalculate=nativebbox' is used recalculates the native bounding box, while avoiding recalculating the lat/lon bounding box. Recalculate parameters can be used in together - 'recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox' can be used after a bulk import to  to recalculates both the native bounding box and the lat/lon bounding box.

  title: GeoWebCache DiskQuota
  description: The REST API for Disk Quota management provides a RESTful interface through which clients can configure the disk usage limits and expiration policies for a GeoWebCache instance through simple HTTP calls.  Since disk usage increases geometrically by zoom level, one single seeding task could fill up an entire storage device. Because of this, GeoWebCache employs a disk quota system where one can specify the maximum amount of disk space to use for a particular layer, as well as logic on how to proceed when that quota is reached. There are two different policies for managing the disk quotas - Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Least Recently Used (LRU).

      description: |
        This endpoint retrieves details on all loaded JARs. All the GeoServer manifest JARs are marked with the property GeoServerModule and classified by type, so you can use filtering capabilities to search for a set of manifests using regular expressions (see the manifest parameter) or a type category (see the key and value parameter).

        The available types are core, extension, or community. To filter modules by a particular type, append a request with key=GeoServerModule&value={type}

        Use the "Accept:" header to specify format or append an extension to the endpoint (example "/about/manifest.xml" for XML).

        The model is very simple and is shared between the version and the resource requests to parse both requests. You can customize the results adding a properties file called manifest.properties into the root of the data directory.
      produces:
        - application/json
        - application/xml
        - text/html

        Creates a new collection via its search attributes and ogc links. 
        The zip format accepts a set of files creating the collection in a single shot, and will contain the following files: 
        * collection.json: the list of searchable attributes, the format is the same as the one returned by a GET on a collection, the "*HRef" properties should be omitted. 
        * description.html: the HTML description for the collection
        * metadata.xml: the ISO metadata for the collection
        * thumbnail.png: the collection thumbnail (ignored at the time of writing)
        * owsLinks.json: the list of OWS links, in the same JSON format as the associated resource
        A creation with ZIP is recommend for speed and consistency sake.

        a set of files creating the collection in a single shot, and will contain the following files: 
        * product.json: the list of searchable attributes and eventual OGC links
        * description.html: the HTML description for the product
        * metadata.xml: the O&M metadata for the collection

        * granules.json: the list of granules, in the same JSON format as the associated resource
        The JSON format is the same as the one returned by a GET on an existing product, the "*Href" properties should be omitted

          Using POST with the `application/xml` or `application/json` content only adds the style info to the catalog and does not upload style content. PUT to `/styles/{style}` to upload the style in this case.

          Use POST with a style file (`application/vnd.ogc.sld+xml` or `application/vnd.ogc.sld+xml` for SLD; additional style types are added by extensions) to generate a style info and upload the style all at once. Then seperately PUT the style info at `/styles/{style}` to make any desired changes to the generated catalog entry.
          You can also use POST with a ZIP file to upload a SLD 1.0 (`application/vnd.ogc.sld+xml`) file and any associated icon files, and then separately PUT the style info at /styles/{style}. POST with a ZIP file does not support any other style types.

If the content type used is application/xml the server will assume a <transform> definition is being posted, and the XSLT will have to be uploaded separately using a PUT request with content type application/xslt+xml against the transformation resource. If the content type used is application/xslt+xml the server will assume the XSLT itself is being posted, and the name, sourceFormat, outputFormat, outputMimeType query parameters will be used to fill in the transform configuration instead.

The empty parameter 'recalculate=' is useful avoid slow recalculation when operating against large datasets as 'recalculate=' avoids calculating any fields, regardless of any changes to projection, projection policy, etc. The nativebbox parameter 'recalculate=nativebbox' is used recalculates the native bounding box, while avoiding recalculating the lat/lon bounding box. Recalculate parameters can be used in together - 'recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox' can be used after a bulk import to  to recalculates both the native bounding box and the lat/lon bounding box.

(The native and lat/lon bounding boxes are not automatically recalculated when they are explicitly included in the request.) In addition, the client may explicitly request a fixed set of fields to calculate, by including a comma-separated list of their names in the recalculate parameter.  The empty parameter 'recalculate=' is useful avoid slow recalculation when operating against large datasets as 'recalculate=' avoids calculating any fields, regardless of any changes to projection, projection policy, etc. The nativebbox parameter 'recalculate=nativebbox' is used recalculates the native bounding box, while avoiding recalculating the lat/lon bounding box. Recalculate parameters can be used in together - 'recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox' can be used after a bulk import to  to recalculates both the native bounding box and the lat/lon bounding box.

(The native and lat/lon bounding boxes are not automatically recalculated when they are explicitly included in the request.) In addition, the client may explicitly request a fixed set of fields to calculate, by including a comma-separated list of their names in the recalculate parameter.  The empty parameter 'recalculate=' is useful avoid slow recalculation when operating against large datasets as 'recalculate=' avoids calculating any fields, regardless of any changes to projection, projection policy, etc. The nativebbox parameter 'recalculate=nativebbox' is used recalculates the native bounding box, while avoiding recalculating the lat/lon bounding box. Recalculate parameters can be used in together - 'recalculate=nativebbox,latlonbbox' can be used after a bulk import to  to recalculates both the native bounding box and the lat/lon bounding box.
